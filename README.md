# Project Overview
This project applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to the KMNIST (Kuzushiji-MNIST) dataset, achieving notable performance metrics. The KMNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten Japanese characters (Hiragana), and serves as a more challenging alternative to the traditional MNIST dataset.

# Results
* Training Accuracy: 92%
* Testing Accuracy: 89%
* Epochs: 3
* Processing Time Improvement: 80% (reduced from 183 seconds to 37 seconds using a GPU)
* Confusion Matrix
* A confusion matrix was plotted to visualize the performance of the model and understand the classification results in detail.

# Where to run
You can clone this repo and run the file on google colab by following the steps in the notebook
